## Lab schedule

Fork each lab assignment to your personal GitHub account.

Labs are in-class practice work. They are not graded, but you may submit a pull request if you would like feedback on your solutions.

Continuing lab work outside class is great for getting in your additional self-study practice time but- wokring on homework/projects should come first.
